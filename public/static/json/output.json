    "description": "Originally, Optimism considered introducing an attestation-based challenger module as a pathway towards decentralization. Though focus has shifted towards fault proofs, the attestation-based module remains a fascinating and worthwhile concept. Instead of a multisig, this module would utilize a smart contract that verifies EIP-712 signatures. ",
