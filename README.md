# Get Inspired with Builder Ideas!

Welcome to the Optimism Collective Builder Ideas! 

Knowing where to start building can be overwhelming. Donâ€™t worry though, we have you covered! Here you'll find various ideas that are intended to be a guiding light ðŸ’¡as you start contributing to the Collective; from developer tooling to protocol experiments, and much more! These ideas have no guaranteed rewards, however by building them you may have a positive impact you can use to apply for Reto Funding. Builder ideas are here to provide guidance on what you could build for the Optimism Collective ðŸ’–

Choose an idea from the list, build it, create impact, and you might get rewarded via Retro Funding for your impact!

If you are looking for a grant, you can find available [grants](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/get-a-grant/) here. 

There are many different ways you can start contributing to the Collective, and below youâ€™ll find a list of ideas that ideally function as a fruitful starting point. 

## How does the Builder List work?

The Builder List is composed of many ideas for projects! You can find relevant ideas by searching within specific project categories, difficulty, verticals or skill sets!

To get started, merely get inspired by an idea and start building impact!

Itâ€™s important to remember that this list solely represents ideas, or projects to get started with Retro Funding! The goal is for you to get inspired and start building impact. Rewards are not guaranteed for anything built via an idea from the Ideas List. 

### Looking for Proactive Grant Funding?

Ideas List projects are possible starting points for RetroPGF rounds, but if youâ€™re looking for proactive grant funding, you can visit the Ecosystem Contributions page to view specific grants, which we call [Foundation Missions](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/labels/Foundation%20Mission%20Request)! You can learn more about Missions by starting here.

As always, the Optimism Collective is a band of companies, communities, and citizens working together to build a sustainable future for Ethereum by rewarding impact! The Collective is motivated by a simple equation of Impact = Profit, where each builder is rewarded in proportion to the positive impact they create for the Collective. Get inspired by an idea and start building impact now!
